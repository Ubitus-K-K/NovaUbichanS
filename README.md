# NovaUbichanS
- Version: 0.2.0
- Platform: Unity2022.3.22f1

# Overview
This project aims to create an interactive virtual space where live streaming, online communities, and AI virtual characters converge. Based on the virtual world of our ambassador, Ubi-Chan, we integrate advanced technologies—including LLM (Large Language Models), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), TTS (Text-to-Speech), and AI Agents—to deliver a rich and diverse live interactive experience. With these innovations, Ubi-Chan can engage in real-time conversations with streaming audiences and interact with other AI virtual characters and scene objects. Viewers can influence character dialogues and the evolution of live content through comments, commands, or specific actions, creating an immersive, multi-character live performance where every message triggers new interactions, making you feel as if you are truly there. This open-source project will provide relevant interfaces and interactive tests as development progresses. For more details, please contact Ubitus K.K.

# Feature
- Build a global AI manager, similar to a village chief, to oversee interactions and changes within the community.

- Enable real-time audience interaction: viewers can influence virtual character dialogues via live chat messages.

- Personalized AI Avatars: leverage RAG technology to endow each AI Avatar with unique personalities, behavioral logic, and emotional responses, enriching the interactive experience.

- Employ a 3D interface based on Unity 3D as the visual core to provide intuitive interaction and expand future editing possibilities for objects and characters.
